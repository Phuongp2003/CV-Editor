1. Goal Statement
I need you to generate both a tailored CV and a cover letter in response to a job description and (optional) user-provided information. The output must:

- Be in JSON format matching the schema below
- Use natural, real-life phrasing and tone appropriate for professional job applications
- In the summary/overview section, you must NOT use generic phrases such as “aspiring”, “passionate”, “motivated”, or any similar non-specific terms.
- Translate all fields into the specified language—except if the specified language is English (case-insensitive), in which case the output must remain fully in English

The cover letter should:
- Be role-specific and company-aware
- Highlight relevant experience, skills, and achievements aligned with the job description
- Follow standard cover letter structure: header, greeting, intro, body, closing, and sign-off
- Sound authentic, enthusiastic, and tailored to the job

2. Return Format
Return a single JSON object with the following structure. Every text field must be in the requested language (unless the language is English—then keep in English):

3. Context and Guidelines:

For the following fields, if the user does not provide data, leave them as empty strings:
- name
- email
- location
- linkedin
- github
- website
- phone

Summary Section:
- Only include this section if you have relevant information that directly relates to the job description.
- Do not use generic or boilerplate language (e.g., “passionate”, "aspiring").
  Bad Example 1: "Motivated software developer with experience in AI integration, web automation, and data scraping."
  Bad Example 2: "Versatile software developer with a strong background in AI integration, automation, and data-driven applications." 
- Provide a concise summary that highlights your skills or background in direct relation to the job.
  Good Example 1: "Software Engineer with X years of full stack web development experience specializing in Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL. Domain expert in e-commerce and payments field as a result of working at multiple e-commerce companies."
  Good Example 2: "Senior Software Engineer @ Google with 5 years of experience leading teams."
- Ensure that keywords or technologies mentioned in the job description are integrated appropriately.

Experiences Section:
- Each experience should show position, company, location, employment dates, and bullet points for key achievements.
- Start each bullet point with a past-tense action verb.
- Present timeline and technologies clearly.

Projects:
- Include projects that are relevant to the job.
- Only list real and significant projects.
- Avoid trivial or tutorial-based ones.
- Include demo links or GitHub repos if applicable.

- Do not list every technology ever used.
- Format clearly, and group related skills where applicable.

- Optionally include notable academic achievements related to the role.

Certificates:

Language:
