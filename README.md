# Professional-CV-Editor

Professional-CV-Editor is a powerful tool designed to help engineering professionals create, edit, and perfect their resumes. It focuses on fast manual editing, clean export (PDF/DOCX/JSON), and convenient profile/language management.

## Key Features

- **Create Professional Engineering Resumes**  
  Build and maintain impressive, tailored resumes specifically optimized for engineering roles.

- **Manual Editing**  
  Easily edit every section of your resume manually to add your personal touch and extra details.

- **Profile Slots**  
  Save multiple “personal profile” presets (name, contacts, language, avatar, etc.) and quickly switch between them.

- **Save and Load**  
  Save your progress as a JSON file and load it later, making it easy to update or fine-tune your resume as needed.

- **Download Options**  
  Export your CV as **PDF** (with embedded fonts for multiple languages) or **DOCX**, ready to send to recruiters or upload to job portals.

- **Multi-language UI**  
  Switch interface language (e.g. English, Vietnamese, and more) via the language dropdown; labels and placeholders adapt automatically.

## How It Works

1. **Fill In Your Information**  
   Enter personal info, summary, skills, experiences (with bullet points), projects, education, and certifications directly in the left-hand form.

2. **Auto Preview**  
   The app continuously generates a high-quality PDF preview on the right as you type.

3. **Save / Load JSON**  
   Use the “Save File” button to export your current CV data as JSON, and “Load File” to restore or edit it later.

4. **Export**  
   Once satisfied, export your CV as PDF or DOCX using the buttons in the preview panel.

> Note: There is **no built-in AI generation in the UI** anymore.  
> The `instruction.txt` file and `example_res.json` remain as references if you want to plug your own AI backend that outputs CV JSON in the documented schema.
